Regret buying it.As a survivor there's no real reward in completing generators. Sure you just move on to the next one (where there's 5 in total) and so on. Whenever the killer gets you there is a ""Press to wiggle"" function. This gives you a chance to break free from the killer and escape. He then drags your over to a hook. where he will impel you untill a survior comes to your aid. It would've been a great feature if the hooks weren't 2 inches from each other. And if you are new to the game and are a low level character there's not much fun in it for you. You have to grind and grind your character to a certain level before you can start to have a slight of a chance. And those perks includes things like tool boxes which makes you repair generators faster a simple flashlight so you can see! and so on. This game introduces itself in the worst way. Looks like fun when you watch someone else play it. And it doesn't explain you that you need to put hours into it before you can perhaps enjoy it.

2016-11-23,0,0,496,False,Recommended,Nov 2017 This game is reaching the potential that it first had the developers are far more thoughtful when it comes to problems they dont rush to bring out unbalanced DLC to make more money. This game is a lot of fun.You need a thick skin to play killer you will always have salty survivors you killed being toxic. BUT if you play this game with the intention of it being for fun and dont care about dying or about making sure someone dies on a hook (camping) then this game is a whole lot of fun. Try it you might just love it.Nov 2016 This game all depends on your outlook. If you are easily triggered by other players features in a game that make it unfair or developers that dont fix issues that are underlying in the game (camping Infinites etc) then this game wont be for you.Its got issues which are slowly being worked out. There should be a patch on the day I am writing this review to lessen the grind for perks and prestige. HOWEVER if you play this game for fun (and not too focused on getting points or the full win) then this game is fantastic. If you play the game how the devs envisioned it to be played (its not too hard to work out what the wanted dont be a and ruin the game for other people i.e camping) then this game is very good fun especially with teammates. You must have a thick skin though and be prepared to ignore the salt that happens at the end of every game from the people that will whine at you. Killer get this much worse so many surviors will rage at you regardless of what you did in the game.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-22,0,0,34,False,Recommended,Dead By Daylight is a great horror game.I bought the deluxe edition the artwork ost and masks for payday were worth the price in my opinion So Now to the real game.So this game was a wonderful horror game.They were great at making us fear the killer.The sudden shocks and the heartbeats makes the game more realistic.Although there are a few stuff that you can use to make the game easier the killer also could use it as well.This game has a fair balance between killers and survivors which is good although the killer is faster and has more senses than survivors killers make noises which makes it obvious for survivors.On the other hand Survivors only make noises if they fail at repairing a generator.The Camera is quite nice with the third and first person thing.Pros Great GameplayMatching Soundtrack Fair Balance of ClassesGood artworkAwesome EnvironmentsGets the 'spooky feel' to the gameCons a few bugsMultiplayer survivors quit easily even in game.No full storyline we only know a bit of each character and none of each killers.Result 9/10The game itself is very interesting yet the bugs and how survivors can quit easily in multiplayer is quite annoying.The story itself isnt too clear yet the great and Terrifying gameplay would make the game worth the price.(voted this for better than expected),Dead by Daylight

2017-09-22,0,0,24,False,Not Recommended,"I honestly never do reviews and could care less to do them but this game has really struck a cord. I bought this game while it was on sale a week ago and as soon as I played it I ""screamed"" with horror and joy. There was finally a horror game I could play with friends and have fun with. However once I started playing more I noticed some killers seemed a tier above others and completely overpowered. So I looked at the list of killers and soon realized that those characters were the ones you had to buy. I initially shrugged it off and thought maybe it was just coincidence that those were the ones always beating my friends and me. But the more we played the more I saw the trend of us losing to these ""pay to win"" killers. You would run into someone who has over 400 hrs in game but were low rank with these killers and being new players to this game we would get creamed.Now I know it isn't all fair with the normal killers so I think things should change there but my gosh the skill difference between these paid killers and normal survivors (especially for new players) can just ruin the entire game! I mean it gets pretty annoying when you have Michael Meyers slashing you from 4 ft away and follow you through every obstacle and gaining on you to be killed. Then have the killer at the end of the game calling you ""an alternative name for a cat"" and to do better (even though he has 500 hrs in game and ranked the lowest you can be).Honestly I would rather watch Zombeavers than play a potentially great horror game.",Dead by Daylight

Matchmaking is still ed however you can now play a game (it's just not going to be matched very well).

This would be less of a bother if I had ai bots to fail in front of a proper tutorial or at the very least a method of organizing players by their ranks so I'd fail as much as everyone else. This game has none of the above. (IF it does have a method of organizing players by rank then it seems awfully strange how everyone is already at their top ranks and nobody seems to be new to this at all considering how I was just dropped in the middle of expirienced players. Twice.) As a killer you can't just kill a survivor. You'll have to attack the survivor then drag his/her body to a meat hook HOPING that another survivor didn't break it all within a certain period of time. I've been told that you CAN kill a downed survivor if you can find a ""memento"" which I find to be completely rediculous. If you're a killer aren't you supposed to.....well kill people!?As a survivor fixing a generator requires a quicktime action. Because the developers will not have mentioned this ANYWHERE you will most likely fail the first time you touch a generator and either get slaughered because of it or hurt your team's chances at survival because of it.This isn't tf2 pd2 csgo etc. where you can fail in front of ai bots or recieve proper tutorials. This is a polished yet unfinished game that you have to pay for in more than one way. It MIGHT improve over time but as of now I wouldn't recommend you play it at all unless if you know 2 3 other people who also play it.If you want a good slasher game where you play as the killer I'd recommend ""Party Hard"". It's storyline is decent most of your attacks are stealthy and strategic and the best part You aren't expected to know what you're doing before you're supposed to know what you're doing.",Dead by Daylight

2016-07-06,1,2,182,False,Recommended,Product received for free. The direction of the game is very well. I would definitely recommend it to people who love games with endless hours of playability and a new difficulty in every match. While there are lots of cons to this game such as no party system and hook camping the game is in early access. Pro tip If the killer is a hook camper continue to work on generators. As the hooked survivor is hanging and being camped you will have plenty of time to repair generators.Why should I buy this game? Dead by Daylight has unlimited playablility. While the objective is the same it never feels repetitive to me. Just like CSGO or any other game. If you want to sink your heart and soul into a game Dead by Daylight may be the game for you. What's to come? The developers are working on a party system as of this review and plan to add more maps items survivors and killers. The game in its current state is well priced and really worth it. Why should I believe you? Maybe you shouldn't. But give the game a go it's definitely worth your while. Most negative reviews are about the bugs but I find the bugs to not be that game ruining at all. Playtime as of review 47 hours,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-27,0,0,1208,False,Recommended,"Alright. First check how many hours I've had in this game. That alone should be saying something. (I was job hunting and had plenty of time alas those days are over)I could write a 10 page review on this marvelous masterpiece but I will keep it short and sweet This is why you NEED to buy Dead by Daylight.Best 18 20 bucks I've spent in AWHILE. As a lifelong gamer I really can say this is a top 10 favorite.The pros ++ The music and sound effects alone make the experience literally get your heart beating faster. Hell I think it even boosts your metabolism because of how on edge you can become.+ The game looks pretty cool. I like the style of landcape etc. The maps they have now 3 main areas with smaller sub areas are incredible as they are now but there are still updates and new maps in the future. I've played easily over 100 matches and in 3 maps I can say with confidence that it has NOT gotten old. I'm really impressed as being someone who plays everything from Dark Souls to Elder Scrolls to Fallout.+ If you are like me and loved hide and seek and tag when you were a kid and also now you'll love this because basically this is a ""grown up"" version of that game.+ The team aspect is excellent. Banding together makes repairing healing and basically ensuring your survival a lot easier and it doesn't feel poorly done or forced. I usually like working alone but this game really makes the working with others aspect appealing.+ The items/loadout works very well. Plenty of offerings to put forward and the items available are straight to the point.+ The stealth aspect and hiding behind objects etc. works nearly flawlessly and the feeling you get when the killer runs RIGHT BY you is unparalleled.+ The multiplayer aspect plus the ability to play with friends makes it that much more entertaining.Negatives Several glitches even in the introductory part of the game while you are waiting in the lobby. That one can be overcome but then there's some really frustrating ones in game especially if the killer's internet is because you rubber band all over or it's choppy and there's lag delays. Although I love the 3 maps I would definitely say more maps would definitely not be out of the question.I'd love to answer any Qs you may have as I almost literally know this game inside out!",Dead by Daylight

2017-11-22,0,0,591,False,Recommended,Reccomending this game is very difficult. This game is loaded with gamebreaking bugs and glitches that can make it a frustrating experience. However if I was not frustrated I wouldn't care and this game is one of the best experiences I can have in steam. This game is not beginner friendly in the slightest but that just makes it so much more rewarding when you can finally escape the killer. The meta shifts greatly and currently I am not a fan of the whole pallet looping meta we got going on but that's okay. Constant new updates keep the game fresh as well as fix many issues with the game. Personally I liked daily rituals better when there was a big deal and you could get over 100 thousand bloodpoints but I guess it's okay. Overall this game is highly competitive and for good reason.

The night I purchased this I bought it along with four other friends and we played a few hours in a private group the issue came when one person left....We quickly realized that this game has no public match group support so you can solo q or well you can solo q. If you dont happen to have a full group of five people then you arn't even able to private q so basically you are unable to play with friends. More over not only can you not play with friends you can't even play with the community. Basically there are no redeeming social aspects to the game and for that I give it a huge thumbs down. I have read that the dev is ""working"" on making group play a real thing but before that they want to make sure people who drop out of games early are punished better. I don't understand why this game even has a ranking system or trys to promote any kind of e sports functions. If it was a lets try to survive a psycho killer with your friends that had all the fun and screams that I enjoyed with a full group of people then it would be a home run.

BUT i've been having loads of fun playing this game it's competitive it's a bit scary although you always want more! It just makes you feel so awesome when you survive or when you actually outsmart the survivors and sacrifice all of them.

2018-06-18,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,"This is one of those times where I wish that Steam had a neutral setting I don't feel absolutely qualified to give the end all point of view on this game but I think the first look of a newcomer is a valuble perspective to look at.The game is an absolute thrill to jump onto with a group of friends and is the only way I can really recommend the game. From the menu screen to the perk tree from the game to the afterwards eveything is downright atmospherically creepy. The ""uneasy"" horror feeling is very well captured. Whether you're screaming and running from the killer or desperately fixing a generator the game succeeds in bringing out that heart pounding exhilaration of Outlast or Penumbra.However after a few hours you can already see the writing on the walls. The game takes itself a bit too seriously it seems. IMO this game is best as a scary casual experience but like with most games a few select people want it to be more than that. You might be a little noob laughing your off and running around aimlessly with your friends... The killer has over 500 hours of experience has mastered their character of choice has memorized every map layout knows all spawn location patterns all generator points etc. The game's counter to this is a constant balancing tweaking reworking everything from perks to villains. This again in turn supports the feeling that the game is trying to be something its not... some kind of actual competitive skill based gameplay for the few who take it way too seriously rather than the masses who just want fun.I will return in future dates with my friends and update my review accordingly I just hope they make the game more casual terror filled fun as opposed to a competitive wipe the floor meta experience )",Dead by Daylight

2016-06-25,0,0,110,False,Recommended,BRILLIANT AND FAVOURITE GAME!This is an extremely fun game to play with friends. In some cases it is okay to play online however you'll find barely any team mates will help you. Other than that this is a really good horror game!With the addition of Survive with friends it has made the game greatly better you can have hours of fun with your friends with a new experience each time.Additionally some of the killers are annoying *cough* the Wraith *cough* and many killers will just camp you on the hooks like they are babysitting you but everyone has their own play styleSome killers are actually quite cheeky and will team up with you and help you repair generators if you help them kick down barricades/ hit you a few times for points. GETTING INTO GAMESAs of patch 1.0.5 trying to get into games is absolutely horrible you could be sitting in a lobby getting 'no matches found' and then finding that the killer leaves because he is matched with high level players. KILLERS STOP BEING S.OPINIONSPersonally i get randomely taken off the game whilst normally playing due to unknown errors where a message is displayed asking why you were taken off the game which i suppose is good for the developers and their future enhancements.The ranking up system is slightly bad you have the skill tree level which is fantastic then the survivor/killer rank where you have to win numerous games in a row to rank up an XP system of some sort would be prefered (opinion)Again the game is really fun when managing to get into a game and i play i have much fun playing it for hours on end,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-25,2,4,247,False,Recommended,I don't really feel like I need to review this game. Because of its popularity by now everybody should know what they're buying.It's abit like hide and seek but the killer is always it. You're trapped in an area and need to fix generators to restore power to the door. Open the door to escape sounds pretty simple right? You already know anyway?The replayability of this isn't amazing. I can come back to it occasionally but as you can see I don't have masses of hours on record. Thats because its the same thing over and over. I would still recommend it though especially if you have a group of people that own it. A major downfall for a Twitch streamer is they also VERY TEDIOUSLY don't allow you to rank up in Custom games. If they don't want it to affect ranked they need to at least a seperate system so you actually have a goal or get benefits from playing games. I grew tired very quickly because I play with friends/viewers alot and no end game reward kills it. It's not even that hard to implement. Dev's if you're reading this just please.I'm not a ranked try hard. If I was I would probably say playing Ranked on a broken game would be way too stressful. I'm out on it completely. The glitches are REALLY f**king annoying and you can do really well but t**ts will just immediately leave when they get killed.I feel like the developers are working on this I recommend because of this. I know I've torn this game to pieces but they'll probably add more characters and alot of content. You know what its about you know what you're getting. If you're reading this you think it looks fun.

I'll address the popular negative review points.**BUGS** I haven't encountered a lot of bugs just one. Sometimes when i'm trying to crouch and move I just stop moving. And I'm not sure if it's my computer's problem or the map's. I have played all 3 maps and it happened in all of them.**LOBBY ERRORS**I had wait times of less than a minute connecting as a survivor you do get the ""failed to join lobby"" error but you just have to re click the ""join lobby"" until you get one. Never took me more than 2 clicks. I feel like the issue is mostly not enough killers (killers make lobbys) and too many survivors. Reading the reviews made it sound a lot worse than it actually was and this is at best a slight annoyance like seriously REALLY minscule. **PARTY GAMES**Devs are working on it and by their developer updates it seems like it's coming along swimmingly. Honestly I don't have anyone else to even play with so this is not a deal breaker for me. **BETA VS FULL RELEASE**As I did not have access to the beta I cannot really comment on this The only issues I kinda have with this full realease I wish there were more maps survivors and killers. Hopefully more will be coming I haven't heard anything about that.Whew! Now that we got the main complaints out of the way. Let's talk...**GAMEPLAY**I actually had a lot of fun with this. The soundtrack is great and the mechanics are awesome. Fortunately I didn't deal with any window chessing people rage quiting and my rank managed to stay inttact. Playing as a survivor is actually wikcked fun and it's actually stressful. You can't attack but you can outsmart Just be aware of your surroundings As a killer you have awesome traps and abilities. **IN CONCLUSION**This game has great gameplay and if you're willing to do a few clicks to join a lobby then this game is for you.

If your a killer (you get hate) If your a medic you get all the (love) in the world. For newplayers Try to youtube or google a few tips if you need them. Last on the list...HAVE FUN!

Another thing are the campers/ area camping. There are killers that camp near you to prevent you from escaping regardless if other survivors are trying to rescue you. This has been going on since the beginning when the game was released and the developers refuse to do something about it cause they dont see it as a ""big deal"".

I know you said you aren't doing anything about camping after it being abused but at least try no matter how much abuse it gets. Make that 15% that are fair and play the game normally happy and try. If not your game may die from F13 (it unlikely but it's always possible).Or another thing pallet looping or sitting at pallets. Bloodlust helps a chase end quicker but they can fall into a pallet looper's tricks even easier now and get stunned over and over and OVER! I have an idea to stop this or at least make it harder for those who sit around make it so only a pallet can be dropped while running.There are many other things I could complain about but i would be sitting here for hours.Please BHVR step up your game with this.

Things I wish I'd known before I purchased Skill Tree. Sounds REALLY fun BUT (there are so many ""buts"" when describing good parts of this game) you can only earn bloodpoints (which you spend on skills) in public matches. However you can't queue for public matches with your friends. So your options are 1) Be able to take advantage of the skill tree and improve your character 2) Play with your friends. Not both. Honestly I wish I would have known that when I purchased because I would have waited for it to be added.Load times. Holy hell. After you wait about 5 minutes to finally put together a group due to people constantly jumping in and out of lobbies (if you and a friend both enter a quick play game at the same time you have a chance of both being entered into the same lobby so people are CONSTANTLY trying to do this) you hit the loading screen for a good 2 minutes before the game finally starts.Balancing....or lack there of. Let me tell you how a typical game goes as a survivor. Killer will eventually find you he grabs you puts you on a hook killer camps your body. One of two things happens now. 1) You die because no one saves you. 2) Someone saves you but the killer immediately hits you and you puts you right back on the hook and then you die immediately. Neat.Between the glitches the horrible mechanics around punishing (or not punishing) for DCs (this has been mostly addressed it seems but should have been done and perfected during beta) and the skill tree nonsense I outlined above (how hard would it be to have a ranked and unranked skill tree?) I can't recommend this. These are the problems I'd expect from a beta or an early access game not a full release.All that being said I do think this game can be good given the amount of effort they appear to be giving after release so assuming the updates keep coming and we either get a way to have an unranked skill tree or the ability to queue for ranked games with friends I'll update this review.",Dead by Daylight

I don't have an issue with any of them really. What I do have an issue with is bloodlust III. It is an inevitable down. Doctors add ons give him far too much reach which is why players dc the second they see he is the killer.Other Fixes pallet drops on killers holding victims... the killers aren't dropping victims when they are flashlighted AND blinded or when a pallet is dropped on them. This is a major bug. Also 99% sabotaging hooks and then having to start them all over again... this has killed me several times in my mose recent games. It seems to be a bug. Also unhooking from all directions needs to be fixed so it actually works.... or even just take it out I ve noticed it encourages camping even more than the encouragement it had before. Also the NEW POINTS SYSTEM... No One likes the 2 hooks for everyone and one kill or 2 kills for pip system... we'd rather have to get x amount of points.Aesthetic things If it looks like I can fit through the space between a damn tree and a rock I should be able to run in the space between the tree and rock or whatever the hell I m trying to fit in between. This has caused many deaths and not all of them are my own. DUDE I VE A SEEN A SET OF TIRES SPAWN IN FRONT OF A CHEST!!!!!! That means ithe chest can't be opened! &lt Fix thisAlso face camping is very encouraged as of late... which is anooying when the new hooks aren't working.And not enforcing the rules by banning or suspending players or deducting blood points or anything of the sort that may be used as punishment for cheating or unsportsmanlike playing is building a pretty toxic community. Where in end game chat we read things like ""blah blah blah"" ""u salty idiot"" ""moron"" and then the person talking to you dc's before you have a chance to ask if something like if the game was bugged or if they were cheating because a totem they didn't play just happened to be in the game. DBD really needs to start enforcing rules and looking into/at reports and gameplay to see which players should be banned/punished even if for a short period of time. This will make gameplay more enjoyable especially for players who see a lot more potential growth for the game if the rules were to become enforced.P.S. I do recommend this game to others.

2017-11-02,0,0,954,False,Recommended,"This game is an amazingly fun game even more fun if you find and play with friends. For the time I have played I loved this game as a challenging and competetive game. The base of the gameplay is that you can choose to play either Killer or Survivor. If you select Killer you host a match. There is one Killer in a round and 4 survivors your objective as a killer is to kill or sacrifice the remaining survivors to please the entity (A mysterious spider like being) If you select survivor you are placed in a lobby created by the killer. The objective as the survivor is to communicate with other team mates to survive. To escape the wretched entity's trial you must fix 5 generators to do so it takes about 2 3 minutes to fix one gennerator. While fixing a generator a minigame called ""skillchecks"" randomly apear if you hit the skillcheck in the white or outlined area you pass the skillcheck with no problem if you hit it in the white area you get a little boost in repairing however if you miss the skill check by hitting it too early or too late it notifies the killer visually and gives away your possition. Once you repaired all the generators you have to open an exit gate. The exit gates are revealed to all survivors for a prior amount of time however the killer can see it for ever. to open the gates there is a lever you must take about 15 30 seconds holding the lever down to open the gate. Once opened you are able to escape. That was the base point of the game as a survivor the killer must hit you 2 times to be able to put you on a hook. The killer is able to grab you from generators or other obstacles to automaticaly be able to hook you. Team mates are able to heal you and unhook you. One of the best ways of escaping the killer is to hide or use Pallets flashlights or faking out to slug the killer. As the killer you have a ""Power"" using this ""Power"" allows you to catch the survivors easily. I love that every killer has a unique power.One thing that i wouldn't like for them to continue is that they keep adding popular Horror movie killers. Don't get me wrong it is amazing and fun to play them but i would like a bit of originality like the huntress or hag. But over all I extremely suggest this game.

2018-07-25,0,0,641,False,Recommended,Dead By Daylight is flawed but extremely addicting and fun.The flow of gameplay can make for some tense moments in gameplay. Though if you're goint into it to be scared I think you'll be disapointed. Each killer has a unique and interesting ability to shake up gameplay. However with each new patch new bugs are introduced which can take you out of the experience very quickly. On top of that the fanbase can be very toxic on both sides which can often detract from the experience both in the game and on the forums.

2017-02-17,0,0,0,False,Recommended,Product received for free. A review Comparing DbD to Friday the 13th The Game. (Since these two fanbases butt heads a lot and draw comparisons constantly)It's a solid experience but Dead by Daylight just isn't scary to me. It feels too much like a video game and not enough like a horror movie. If that makes sense?Like I played DbD and found it to be tense but less in the fun way more in the game y way. I don't like how you have to hang people on hooks and a big monster comes from the sky. That all seems less scary and more silly to me. I don't enjoy that it feels like a game show with an arena and clear exits that need power to open. I don't like the consumable items that carry between rounds. That also detracts from immersion for me. I wanna feel like I'm seriously being hunted. Friday the 13th The Game even in Beta accomplished that for me.So for the kind of game I want F13 just fits better. It's my style. I like slower more methodical games and DbD is far from that in my experience. I love how many different kills there are and how visceral it feels and I adore the lighting in the game too. It just feels right to me.So in my opinion even though the beta was totally buggy the core mechanics are so strong that it remained fun to play despite it's glitchiness. That instills a lot of confidence in me as a customer.I just feel acutely aware that I'm playing a video game with DbD. I don't want to feel that way. I need to get pulled into the world. However all that said DbD is still a solid game and worth taking a look. I wouldn't say it's bad. That's why I still recommend it. Overall while not my speed I don't think it's a bad game. I can see what people love about it. It's just those same things they love I am not so keen on. But that doesn't make this a bad product. Give it a try!

2016-07-07,1,1,131,False,Recommended,"The game is in full swing and the game is really enjoyable however people will abuse the killers powers which makes the game lose its enjoyment. The game mechanics still need to be edited to where killers and survivors are on an equal playing field when all survivors are working togehter. I am not high ranking but I have noticed that most killers abuse their abiltites and some even use other glitchy methods to their advantage. I enjoy the concept and love the games design but further editing to the killers functions needs to be a neccessity and survivor teamwork needs to be buffed. My recomendation would be to add in a stamina meter for both the surviors and killers. This would mean that vaulting and putting down barricades wears down your stamina than just sincerely running away from the killer. The killer holding onto survivors will slow down when holding onto to them and will have to plan out attacks as stamina recovery for killers for each kill goes down each time. I feel if these last few changes are added in the game will be at its completion and I do believe revisory of certain perks are needed on both sides so that way ""everyone"" can be on a equal playing field.",Dead by Daylight

That's just a bonus. (Fun fact Play the hag if you REALLY want to off the survivors.) The perk system feels rewarding as each perk can provide a large advantage to it's user survivor and killer alike.

I'm actually over playing this game simply because joining a lobby is so glitchy and more often than not fail prone that it's actually become unplayable. Not to mention the overwhelming killer advantage no matter when the suvivor killer ratio is due to camping capability and no legitimate suvivor options to respond with.

2018-02-15,0,0,18,False,Not Recommended,Oh boy where do I begin?Let's start with how the game itself is littered with bugs and unoptimization. Simply trying to team up with friends is a chore and we haven't even got to the gameplay. The whole invite screen isn't even a part of the game but rather some odd Steam invite system that doesn't work sometimes.Other than starting up the real 'fun' comes from the gameplay. You start out with absolutely nothing and you'll end up paired with an experienced player with several perks and offerings. There isn't any form of balanced matchmaking because the developers don't seem to understand balance. On multiple occasions you will run into a killer who camps the hooks for XP making who ever comes near his next victum. If you aren't lucky your teammates will be trash and not attemt to help others but rather run around the map doing their own thing. Oh did I mention that there is no way to communicate?Overall the game needs fixed. It can be great but only if the developers devote their time to it. I remembered that the X mas lights were still on the hooks mid January.3/10. Why not add a text chat?,Dead by Daylight
2018-08-17,0,0,41,False,Recommended,3/5. Don't get me wrong i enjoy this game a lot however there are a few things that could be changed. For starters the Killers need a slight nerf. Killers are pretty overpowered and getting away from them is nearly impossible. With that being said i enjoy the challenge of being a survivor and 4 vs 1 definitely has its perks if you're playing with people who know what they're doing. The other thing that i would say causes this game to lose a star is the DLC. Why charge extra money every time you make something new for the game... There needs to be other ways for them to make money besides suckering people in at $7 for a DLC of freddy kreugar,Dead by Daylight

2017-10-07,0,0,35,False,Not Recommended,Hide and seek... I mean Dead by Daylight is horror survival attempt that matches 4 players (survivors) against one (the killer). The players have a few cosmetic options and they can start the match with a selection of perks an item (if they are survivors) and loadouts for that said item (or their special ability in the killer's case) and each player can burn 1 offering that can alter the map give them point boosts at the end or some advantages during the match. Survivors have to repair 5 generators and then they can open one of the 2 exit gates (or both) and escape while the killer has to put them down and hook them in order to sacrifice them to the Entity.The outcome of the game is decided like this 1) If the killer has the execution offering he has 100% chance of winning. Only the last survivor standing can escape using the hatch (a secret exit which appears when the first 2 generators are repaired and opens when there's only one survivor left alive) and that still counts as a win for the killer.2) 60% map layout. If generators are close to each other the killer wins. If they are out in the open the killer wins. If not survivors have a good chance of escaping. And if the map has a decent amount of pallets walls windows and cornfields and the generators are not close to each other then it becomes rather easy to escape without even being spotted by the killer.3) 30% perks loadouts and offerings (besides the execution one). There are killer perks that greatly decrease the killer's terror radius (a survivor's strongest help in being aware of the killer's presence) perks that greatly increase the killer's FOV essentially making killers incredibly harder to escape and to hide from. Survivors have some handy perks such as self healing sabotaging without toolboxes walking twice as fast while crouching and short movement burst which really don't help much if the killer is decent enough to read your scratch marks which leads to &gt 4) 10% player skill the killer's skill in particular. There are some jukes you can perform to confuse the killer and escape from his LOS unless he has one of the 2 perks that increase your FOV if he has the frequent bleeding perk on a lit map... or if he doesn't play with his volume turned off and he actually listens to the sound FX.A good killer who's paying attention will NEVER fail to catch a survivor this is how this game is designed. A survivor running around leaves so many traces the scratch marks being the most over powered innate perk that every killer has. If you don't run away you will be caught very quickly and if you do you will still be caught in part due to the trail that tells the killer exactly where you went but hey you'll buy some time at least. The trail is really messy and easy to spot by the killer. It can be used to a survivor's advantage on a dumber killer and it will even work on a skilled one if you do the trick while out of his line of sight but if you've already been hit by the killer once it's over. Your character's regular moans will destroy your chances of escaping and all you can hope for is that the killer is deaf. Considering how the first hit is free most of the time a killer starts chasing you thanks to this game's limited means for a slow survivor to get away from a speedy killer you can guess the outcome of most chases in this game.Playing against a low level killer is a fun experience I don't find anything more rewarding in this game than escaping from a killer especially when you have no idea how he passed by without noticing you. But against any decent killer it comes down to hiding as well as you can and rescuing survivors and being rescued unless... you know... (1)Playing as a killer is simple. You can win without using any special abilities unless the map favors the survivors. Perks are not much of a factor except for the 2 types mentioned above which make the game excessively one sided as they negate/ any advantages a survivor has over the killer (the FOV and the ability to sense when a killer is near). The map can often obstruct a killer's sight but it can also obstruct a survivor's movement making the game more of a hide and seek. Skyping with your friends as a survivor while matching together can make things A LOT easier and while not that common in lower rank play it turns things entirely on the survivors' side giving the killer a game breaking experience. If you hook a survivor and camp him/her you will end up with at least 3 generators done if you don't camp the survivors he's absolutely going to be freed in no time.To conclude things I find DBD to be an unbalanced game. While this can spice things up at first it quickly becomes a nuisance.I'd only recommend this game if you have a group of friends to play with as a team or if you like to play as a killer out of a horror movie. I might be a bit harsh because this game failed to deliver what I expected from it. In a few words I can describe Dead by Daylight as acomplex hide and seek,Dead by Daylight

2017-01-31,0,0,196,False,Recommended,"Do not listen to the negative reviews of this game. Dead by Daylight has been an awesome experience that I'm still enjoying and will continue enjoying for months to come. First off here is what bothers me (and almost everyone else too) The connection when getting chased by the killer will almost garuntee that if you hop through a wall and the killer swings at you youre probably going to take a hit even though you're well past the wall. This is aparently because the game is hosted by the killer when you're in the lobby. So you as the survivor you need to take that knowledge onto the field and attempt to escape another way if you think that youre going to get screwed going through a window. WITH THAT BEING SAID. I love this game. Almost every game I enter my heart starts beating and the adrenaline rush hits me. You probably wont be good at this game for a day or two until you grasp some of the main functions of escaping the killers grasp. Like hiding breaking the running marks enough to confuse the killer using your perks the correct way and applying team work when you cannot communicate with the other survivors.The maps have some of the same looks but theyre all each procedurally generated so nothing is usually exactly the same. This witholds both the killer and the survivors the ""home field advantage."" However if you play the game enough youll begin to learn how to out manouver the killer so that youll have just enough time to make a quick getaway. Each killer has their own special ability so you'll get to learn how they each function and how to best beat them. The same thing goes for the survivors. Everyone has their own thing that will help out their teamates and make it about teamwork. All in all I'd give this game an 8 out of 10. Try it out with a friend. It's a lot better than playing solo.",Dead by Daylight

2017-01-30,0,0,1244,False,Recommended,My first rewiew so bare with me.This is a really fun game and simple enough.Four survivals trying to get out of a compound and a killer that are trying to slaughter them. You can choose several killers (like Mike Myers or a crazy hillbilly with a chainsaw) and several survivals depending on your preference. The leveling system is easy. You get bloodpoints for winning or loosing but of course more for winning. You spend them on perks skills offerings and some items that you use in game. At the same time the more bloodpoints you spend the higher level you get 50 is max level. The more games you win the lower rank you get starting at 20 (lowest) and max is numero uno (highest).Play solo or with friends. I d say that its a bit more fun to play with friends but unfortunatly i dont have that many friends playing this game so its more solo for me still very funny.Now to the sad part the game is buggy. It gets better all the time with patches but still buggy. I cant play survival without playing a killer game first! and i cant play two games in a row as a survival. As a killer there is no problem so i mostly play killer. Its a bit sad because it would be fun to mix more between killer and survival.If you can endure these bugs this game is a diamond in the rough. As i said earlier the game gets better with each patch.

2017-11-30,0,0,436,False,Recommended,"It takes some time to figure out which killer suits you best in order to have fun as killer. I started out as the Wraith (Dude with bell that goes invisible) and Hag (Green small female killer long arms) only to find out that I have most fun with the trapper (Bear trap killer)FRIENDLY / SALTY INGAME COMMUNITY? The community is pretty much as salty in the game itself as people complain about on the forums. I often see killers and both survivors ""gg"" ""nice teamwork ""nice chase"" after a completed game. But the overflow of ""ez game"" ""trash killer "" ""camping TFUZGUZ"" "" )&amp (? Killer"" on the survivor's side massively overshadows all of that.People tend to complain about camping killers or looping survivors. Survivors can be cocky at times. Like all 4 survivors sitting in front of the exit gate until they see the killer approach and then escape together. Just to let the killer see how they all escape into his face. Then after the match write ""Easy"".Even tho I am a Survivor Main I would say that its the survivors that try to abuse the game more often when at the same time getting really salty on the killers. These things started happening to me when I got past rank 15. So a little bit later in the game like 30hours gameplay.NOTE the devs say camping is a valid strategy surivors should do gens when the killer wants to stay at the hook forever. after all it takes 3 minutes to get a survivor from 1st stage to entity summoned. STEAM COMMUNITYI like to send out friend requests to killers/survivors whose gameplay i like have a chitchat on steam and then play together for a while. People really appreciate friend requests as noone wants to play alone on survivor after all. In case that the team and killer are more or less equally skilled it comes down to the map offerings (more fog less fog spawn close to each other which the players use before they spawn into the map.Offernigs do help like they are supposed to however they totally dont win the game by default. BALANCE?The gameplay feels balanced a good killer will own an averge team a good team will own an average killer. Some maps however are quite disadvantageous for killers i m referrring to the Kornfield Maps. However one map is really bad for survivors being The Game. BEING SURVIVOROverall the game feels tense and scary/panicy when the killer owns but controlled/collected when the team owns on survivor mode. Monolog on survivor is sth like this"" f f f f f f f ff f ! ! ! "" ""where is he where is he where is he??????"" ORhe hehe he he second generator doooOOOne biaches! Ok LETS DO THIS!BEING THE KILLERwhereas the killer s gameplay feels fun and exciting when winning or frustrating when failing.HOWEVER! I personally only feel frustrated on killer when i didnt hook a single player. Killing one or more for me is already like a win and the game gives you as killer the most points overall just for chasing injuring and hooking (without en doing the actual kill). Being a killer that doesnt really camp a lot survivors often compliment the match with a ""gg"" ""nice killer gameplay nice chase"" which lightens up my mood even if the scoreboard doesnt.YOUTUBEI watched about 40hours of gameplay on youtube before i decided to purchase the game having seen most of the content before playing it myself didnt take any of the fun away in my opinion.You might think that you always do the same stuff and you basically do. Its your job to do generatos get to exit escape. however there is so much happening inbetween that it does not feel the same. The haste of the match is decided by the kind of killer you encounter the teammates and the map. DLCs Next to that we got many DLCs which are not exactly cheap but 100% not required to play the game. You can access dlc maps without having it purchased you also fight the dlc killers and survivors. the dlc only restricts you into not being able to play the dlc killer/survivor yourself.

While in the first week or two when it was the 3 killers and 4 survivors to choose from I played this game for hours upon hours now I can't play it for more than a single match or two. In its current form it's grown far too much for its own good and this is a classic case of ""Less is more."" With each new killer/character they release comes new perks that can be learned through the Bloodweb which sounds great in theory being that new content is usually a welcome thing in the gaming universe. In my personal opinion all this does is break the balance that game was capable of in the early stages add convoluted new systems and even more potential for perk abuse. Which leads to my next point.The community of this game is the most toxic community I've ever seen next to League of Legends. It's a constant ""Us vs Them"" mentality between Killer mains and Survivor mains where both sides do nothing but cry and complain about broken perks abuse of abilities and how easy the other side has it. As someone who has played both killer and survivor my personal opinion is thus. With respawning hooks to negate sabotage more hooks on the map ability to kick generators being added killers have such a distinct advantage that it's actually boring to play as killer because winning every game only stays fun for so long... and as survivor unless you're playing against a killer who has literally never played before it's going to be fairly uncommon to actually win in the conventional way.TLDR Unbalanced gameplay toxic community too much content to allow for balance and a fanbase too divided to ever allow a happy medium.

2016-06-24,0,0,309,False,Recommended,This game is definetly a fun one to play with but could still use a bit of improvement. There is quite a bit of lag and the match ups can be really bad when new players get paired up against/with level 20+ players. If some of these things are fixed as well as a few other bugs this game has huge potential. Plus who doesn't like hunting and killing their friends?,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-25,0,0,200,False,Recommended,If you like old horror films or enjoy a good rush of adrenaline this should be a game that you'll enjoy. There are plenty of killers to pick from multiple survivors with their own unique perks and a plethora of levels with varied design to entertain yourself with. That being said the community is quite hit or miss and the game itself can be buggy at times. The lobby is one of my major complaints about this game. Half the time it'll join a game only to kick me out and make me re search for another lobby. This is only one of the many problems I've had with this game. Surviving with friends is damn near impossible to get into a lobby for some random reason. (See Edit below)But those issues aside the gameplay is solid and it's good for short bursts or long sessions. It can be something you can lose yourself in.Overall I'd say try it out for the price. Play a game or two to see if you like it. If not refunding is always an option.Edit The lobby issues have since been fixed (including Survive with Friends) since this review and the bugs are less prevalent. Definitely worth picking up if a 4v1 type of game is your style.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-25,0,0,351,False,Recommended,So far the game itself has been good and the leveling system is pretty good. The only con I have is the lobby system as sometimes it can take 5 10minutes trying to start a game. This is due to Survivors trying to play with friends which is fair enough but it does need a decent lobby system. Overall still worth $20,Dead by Daylight

2017-02-01,1,2,253,False,Recommended,"UPDATED REVIEW I wrote the bulk of this back in February '17 and things have changed since then. Check the bottom for the updated parts. If you read through the negative reviews for Dead by Daylight you'll generally find two things genuine complaints about the bugs and people who simply aren't good at the game talking about how this Killer or that Survivor perk is ""broken"" or ""nerfed.""Let's be real for a moment Lots and I mean lots of people are just bad at this game. You'll see them trust me. They either can't learn to work as a part of a team (or can't find others who try which is only a real problem at the lower ranks with all the other newbies) or they don't have the stuff to take down a team on their own. So to start don't pay attention to these particular complaints. They are made by people who as the kids say suck at either specific aspects of the game or the game as a whole.CONS Now on to credible cons. The bugs too often render the game unplayable. I'm looking at you loading screen bug. If you're like me and used to playing buggy games this will be tolerable for you I mean having to exit the game several times and reboot it is by no means an issue to people who make a habit of playing games in their alphas we're almost surprised when we *don't* ever have to relaunch a game. If you don't like the waiting you may struggle with this and that would be a valid reason to avoid Dead by Daylight. Until such a time as the developers finally fix this issue (among others of course) I expect and encourage a lot of complaining about the loading screen bug.Sometimes you'll get put in a lobby with someone either way above or way below your rank. It happens. You'll get butchered by a rank 4 Killer (who isn't really enjoying it either mind you you're too easy) and you'll make a far too easy getaway from a rank 19 Killer who hasn't yet learned how to look in the bushes. This is frustrating for everyone in the lobby and you'll probably catch some flak for it if you were the one misplaced the Survivors in particular (usually ranks 15 10 the ones who have gotten good at the game and are still in their angsty phase of play where they think everyone else sucks and should be told so) can be a salty bunch.More often than you'll probably like you'll get put in a lobby with an Old McDonald's WiFi Killer and you'll lag badly enough that you'll either die because of it or be disconnected entirely. Yeah it's frustrating but that happens in any multiplayer game hosted by one of the players. Somehow people seem to attribute this flaw to Dead by Daylight in particular which is absurd. That being said dedicated servers should they ever become available for the game would be fantastic and that's the half of this complaint that is completely valid.PROS Now that we've addressed the major cons of the game let's look at some of the pros. The way the leveling system works at its core is that you gain points and ranks based on how many points you scored in a match. There's four ways for Survivors and four ways for Killers to get these points. That on its own is a fairly basic and simple system. The part of this system that makes the game great is *what* those ways to get points are. For example as a Survivor you gain points towards leveling by assisting saving or even just being near your fellow Survivors. You make progress in the game by helping each other a seamlessly introduced method of encouraging players to stick together. As a Killer you get points from using your chosen Killer's special power (chainsaw short range teleporting etc.) meaning that you're inherently going to level up as certain Killers better than others you do in fact make a special kind of progress by playing to your strengths. Speaking of leveling while your rank is static across all the different Survivors and all the different Killers each specific member of each group is counted and leveled individually. This means that most of the time a Jake Park player is a Jake Park player that's who you're good at that's who you play. It leaves room for diversity among players because it's not as simple as ""this one does more damage so naturally everyone plays him."" There's no one Survivor or Killer that's better than the next they're all unique in some way and they all play to different types of players' styles and tastes.Finally as a horror game enthusiast when I initially played Dead by Daylight I found that the fear that accompanies hiding from a monster that isn't an AI that is in fact another person was far more satisfying than waiting for the programmed beastie to finish its programmed patrol and move on when I knew it was safe. You can't predict a Killer as easily as that because it's not nearly as easy to know what they're doing. Are they really gone or did they take a few steps away to wait for you to come out? Is he revving up that chainsaw because he actually did see you or is he just trying to scare you out of hiding? Do you stay or do you go? As I played on of course this fear eventually left me. But it didn't fade away it transformed into strategy. I'm not playing a game trying to figure out the patterns of the AI monster I'm trying to either outsmart and outrun or outsmart and run down another person. This dynamic may not be as prevelant at the lower ranks which is natural given that at lower ranks players simply aren't as experienced but should you stick to the game long enough you'll find a unique kind of game that you're going to love just as much at rank 1 as you did at rank 20 if you're anything like me. tl dr If you can't handle bugs waiting and lag this game probably isn't for you. If you're prone to outrage when someone's better at a game than you this game probably isn't for you. If you can appreciate strategy skill and teamwork this game is for you. 8/10 do recommend.UPDATE Dead by Daylight is an ever growing ever changing game. And it's changed a lot since I started playing and since I wrote this review. Lots of new killers and survivors new maps new perks updates to the way things used to work... I won't get into specifics but one thing you can definitely count on is that this game is not a stagnant one. It's still evolving and it's still improving. The community however has overall gotten much saltier since last writing. That's something that can't really be helped by the developers or by other players it just is. All of this being said I've found that the longer one plays Dead by Daylight the *more* hooked one becomes. It's not a game where playing for the first 100 hours is the highlight and it fades from attention after that. In fact you don't even really begin to understand the game until you're much further in. At 171 hours I know enough to stay alive and kill people a lot more efficiently than I used to but I'm still a rookie compared to some of the people that play this game with 500 1 000 3 000 hours logged. If you're looking for a game that'll stick with you as long as you stick with it this is the place to be.Score remains at 8/10.",Dead by Daylight

2016-06-25,0,0,6,False,Recommended,I like it but fix matchmaking. I don't want to come against rank 1 Killers as a rank 20 survivor after my 3rd game / And getting pulled out of windows after you've already done the animation and you're clearly out of the window already is something that needs work,Dead by Daylight
2016-06-25,0,0,5,False,Recommended,So after watching some guys on YouTube play this game and looking like they were having a total blast I decided I could risk the seventeen dollar price. So I'll do a pros and cons thing first and then tell my experiences as survivors and killers.Pros Fantastic premise for a game. Four almost defenseless survivors against one bloodthirsty killer. Love it! It's been quite some time that a game has gotten me this immersed. Like when I'm mere seconds from completeing a goal as a survivor and the killer is coming at me at full speed makes me heart pound. Getting to slaughter a group of young adults in a brutal fashion is a blast.Cons Rampant Disconnection. My very first game had the killer disconnect and shut down the match because us survivors were already opening the exits and he hadn't even injured a single one of us. This has happened about a total of three times out of about ten games. I've noticed a few surivors on my team as well disconnect the moment they realize that we couldn't save them. Only about two times for this. From the forums this looks to be a massive loophole that helps save a players useable items and rank. Devs said they have fixed this. It's not scary. It gets my heart beating from some close calls but I've never been scared. I'd blame this on the 3rd person view survivors always have. Now I almost want to give this a pass since this is first and foremost a multiplayer game survivors need to have 3rd person to survive. The maps are kinda randomly made but not enough to notice any difference. AKA not something that should be advertised as a feature.P.S. These are just issues I have noticed. As a killer I never had a survivor make use of a multiple windows to avoid me forever something a lot of people have brought up. Same goes for Killer perks being useless and survivors being OP.Now onto my little tales.As a survivor I've had multiple close calls. Like I mentioned above opening the gate to escape with only two seconds left until it opens and having the killer be in full site coming at me full speed. These moments are awesome. As are the times you are running for your life with the killer right behind you. Or even hiding in a cabinet as the killer wanders by hoping he doesn't decide to search for you. The only survivor I've played as is Dwight.As for Killers I've done Trapper and Hillbilly. As Trapper it is so fun to lay a perfectly hidden trap and then watch a survivor get caught as they try to save their team. Hillbilly... well I sucked as him. Big time. All four survivors got away and I only hooked one and didn't land a single chainsaw attack. Overall you feel super powerful knowing that the survivors can do barely anything to stop you. TL DR From my experience this game has been a blast. It's intense as a survivor and brutally fun as a killer. For me the sheer amount of fun I've gotten from my short experience is enough to make me feel safe in my purchase.,Dead by Daylight
2016-08-14,0,0,617,False,Not Recommended,"The lobby system sucks Killers dodge all the time because you're too high ranked it's been a problem since the game started and hasn't been fixed. Survive with friends is here but takes forever to queue it's like they didn't even do any user studies to validate that their queue system is useable. Get used to seeing ""No match found"" and constantly clicking your mouse unable to multitask and in the off chance you do find a lobby if you're &lt rank 10.Say you get into lobby you have to spam to see your latency to the host or else you'll end up glitching and teleporting around the map because you have poor connection to the host and you're better off just AFKing and going to YouTube looking for something to watch while you find another game.You'll get matched with people in China and your latency will be above 500ms making the game unplayable. The developers have said they won't add a ping number in the lobby which is not a proper way to address your players.It's a fun game at it's core but riddled with a miserable queue system will leave you frustrated.TLDR Game should be in beta still until they figure out how to properly implement a queue latency check and hiding rank.",Dead by Daylight

2016-09-03,0,0,19,False,Not Recommended,Interesting concept but terribly executed. Aside from the large number of glitches terrible netcode and broken matchmaking there isn't any replayability. Every match is identical from the maps themselves and especially at lower levels the killer strategy is the same every time put someone on a hook and sit there. It's a guaranteed win for the survivors if they ignore them which they never do if they're PUGs because there is no way to communicate but it makes the game boring for both sides regardless of what happens. The maps are barely distinguishable and your survival hinges solely on if you're lucky enough to be near an abusable infinite use window hopping back and forth because the killer so vastly outspeeds you and kills you in at most two hits. This might change at higher levels with perks but there is no incentive to put in the hundreds of hours to get to this point so its largely irrelevant.,Dead by Daylight

There is no point in trying to evade the killer as hacking is rife in this game and the devs refuse to do anything about it. In fact apart from making new events this game is now pretty much abandonware. Also software issues and design flaws these happen a lot. One of the most amusing is when half the team crashes. All that nice shiny rare loot you took into the game? Prepare to lose it because only 2 survivors made it into the game (if you die you lose anything you take in) and there is no way you are going to defeat the killer with half a team.,Dead by Daylight

2016-07-17,1,2,57,False,Not Recommended,Part 4 Another post update review. I'd once again like to commend the developers for being total . Instead of working on matchingmaking services like any sane game designer would do they decided it was more important to release another killer and provide useless scaling patches in order to undo the damages that they did with the previous ones. Only in Dead by would a person decide that having your users play a ready up simulator for 45 minutes prior to getting a game with friends is a praise worthy event. Part 3 Re updating my review again. I'd like to add that after multiple updates the match making system is worse than ever. Not only is it nearly impossible to get into a match but when you do you get put against the who have been playing this game since its conception. If sitting around for 30 minutes without a game trying to queue with your friends prior to getting skull ed is for you buy this game.Part 2 Improving my review from to mediocre. The group matchmaking now actually works in the sense that if you wish to be placed against people that consistantly butt you without any type of lube. Thanks for placing a new player against chodes that have been playing the beta for more cumulative time than they've seen any woman except for their mother.,Dead by Daylight

Depending on the skill of the other players the game can be very challenging or easy. Anyways it s a lot of fun!,Dead by Daylight

Survivors keep getting nerfed and killers keep getting more and more bonuses. New Killer shows that developers encourage camping. While this was frustrating before it could be worked around by grabbing generators while the killer was distracted. Newest killer however has the ability to set traps that grant vision and teleportation to any 10 areas on the map. This gives her the ability to camp multiple locations at the same time. The downside to this omnipresence? N/A.",Dead by Daylight
2017-10-04,0,0,344,False,Recommended,Game is very very cool but as of now it's unbalanced. I'm a survivor main but recently I've started to lose more and more games and I've tried to play killer for fun (and to try to understand why I'm doing this bad right now). Reason is simple game is easier for killers by far. I use the Huntress with only 1 perk (and a bad one) against a premade team of a rank 4 rank 6 rank 7 and rank 17 survivor as a rank 17 Huntress. They all have perks yet I still managed to sacrifice all 4 of them rather easily. No perk practically no experience as a killer vs a team of organised and kindof experienced survivors with good perks and yet I still destroy them happened more than once. Now imagine if I was not colorblind and could actually see and follow the trail survivors leave behind them while running had experience as a killer and ran some op perks like whispers... I agree with the people that claim survivors are 4 vs 1 and should have a hard time escaping but now this is ridicoulous as a survivor there is almost no way to escape the killer because there is less pallets than before killer breaks them faster and killer vaults through windows too fast for me to lose him. If I go fast he just follows the trail I leave behind me. If I go slow I don't have enought distance to break the line of sight. Winrate as a survivor is less than 50% and winrate as a killer is more than 70% (3 or more sacrifices).TLDR Would I reccomend the game absolutely even with the lack of balancing there is still plenty of room for fun ESPECIALLY with friends and the game is totally worth his pricePS sorry english isn't my first language my grammar and/or orthograph may be very bad,Dead by Daylight

2016-10-21,0,0,877,False,Recommended,The game is great fun and each match you play can be different. If you're playing as killer or survivor you can always find ways to change up your strategy. Sometimes you will NEED to. The thrill of almost getting caught by the killer but managing to slip away or the thrill of the chase as the killer. Either way loads of fun.And the developers are awesome! The put out a weekly podcast to let the players know what they are working on next. They are always looking for ways to improve the game and have a real passion for making this game great. They also have great beards.There are some players that take the game too seriously if things don't go their way but that's EVERY online multiplayer game.

2016-08-06,0,0,40,False,Not Recommended,I will start off by saying that this is a fun game you play as a killer hit survivors to down them then hang their bodies on hooks to sacrifice them or play as a survivor and work on generators to get an exit open to escape while avoiding the killer but that fun is soon sapped out of the game when you run into these flaws.1. Continual window hopping survivors. Now to be fair they have tried to address this issue but it's still an issue every map has at least 1 spot that survivors can run around in an infinite circles and it becomes a game of who's going to mess up first. Only problem is you wil get survivors who will not mess up and now you have to give up and go check generators or if all generators are done you have to wait for them to make a run for the exit. Which could be in 10 minutes or 30 minutes how ever long they feel like or until they mess up. 2. TERRIBLE MATCHMAKING. As a survivor or killer I was constantly matched against killers/survivors who were 20 30 even as high as 40 levels higher then me. Now for those of you who don't own this game what this means is im running around against a killer or multiple survivors who have high level perks which will buff them and assist them in some wayand they have multiple of these perks dues to their high level while you have 1 perk available and its a low level common perk. So let paint the picture for you your the killer level 10 rank 20 you get matched against 4 survivors level 30 35 32 45 you have 1 perk you can use say sloppy butcher ( makes them bleed more when you hit them) they all have 4 perks at their disposal lets say one has Saboteur (can disable your hooks and destory traps) and some other ultra rare perks to your common perk. You start the match finally knock down survivors to find there's no hooks nearby (due to saboteur) to hang them on and the nearest one is so far away that they can wiggle free from your grasp before you get there. Annoying huh? especially when all this could be avoided by matching you against players of a similar skill instead of throwing you in a blender against the best of the best as a new player.Now some things to mention these problems could change and some of these problems could be addressed in the future but I would avoid this game until then. Now some people may be fine with grinding and being used as a punching bag to higher rank players until they can level up and rank up themselves but im not if your fine with it then you may not mind this game.,Dead by Daylight

2016-08-20,0,0,2,False,Not Recommended,This game is great tons of fun always something to work towards.The game has LOTs of potential.but it's far from living up to it at this moment.i will change my opinion if they change things.The major issue is matchmaking.I played even before the free to play weekendand spent almost 3 hours getting rolled by killers...they had 3 4 red perks lvl 40 50 and sometimes crazy high rankwhile i was lvl 1 rank 20 with zero decent perks or items.Not only that but if you get downed and hooked you are DONE.Because when you start out you have people who won't save you.Either due to also being new and unknowledgeable or afraid to or just selfish players using you as a distraction.i had 3 games where I popped every generator by MYSELF.and 2 games where i got 3 or 4 BUT and then got caught out.OR... you get killers who hook you and then sit there watching as you die waiting for AGES as you bleed out.Making it impossible for you to be rescued.Which if you don't know the game actually is BAD to do as killer.Because you get no points no exp no score.and you deny the survivor you hooked score/exp.you just gimped both of your scores. for nothing.and new killers do NOT understand this.so you get perma campers every game.and it sucks. very anti fun.the game doesn't really explain that ensuring a killdenies you points from doing other objectives.This is a major issue as the things you unlock via bloodwebare huge factors against others with good perks and items.ESPECIALLY if you are new.Once you understand the game items and perks matter less.but getting low points/exp at the startreally slows your progress to a crawl.The game is EXTREMELY unfriendly to new players though.The only way to play is against others with no clear explainationof most of the mechanics of the game when you first start out.You have to stumble around in the dark LITERALLY.Most of the advantage comes from knowing the mapsand since it throws you straight into ranked...there is no way to really mess around to learn them.I will say this though.I like the game concept and gameplay.But the amount of work and time that I have to playto catch up to the majority of the playerbase...all the while being at a disadvantage...while being matched against much higher ranks...tl drWatch others play the game on twitch or youtubelearn the game through other's eyes firstbecause you don't have the luxury of learning thru your own.also nurse is broken as hellteleporter with auto aim attacks...,Dead by Daylight

2016-12-22,0,0,31,False,Recommended,As much as I love this game and enjoy playing it I find 2 major issues when playing it 1) Randomised spawning is great until you end up spawning 10ft from the killer. It's not fun when the killer can SEE YOU when you spawn. You get a poor score and no currency to spend on levelling up. Since there is ALWAYS a basement somewhere on the map with 4 hooks and a chest surely the killer should always spawn there so the killer can't see the survivers at the moment of spawn?2) Matchmaking can have you with a level 1 surviver no perks or very very basic perks against a killer with a full load out of pink/purple top tiers perks. Again... why bother trying at this point. Surely you should be matched with killers and survivers that match your level with the character you're playing so the experience is fair?Other than that this is a really really fun game but most of the fun is had with friends in a 5 man because of the above reasons online can sometimes leave you feeling a bit... let down by the unbalanced nature of things.,Dead by Daylight

2017-03-12,0,0,4,False,Not Recommended,This game looks good but I assure you it is total garbage!Accurrate reviews I have seen. Lobby Simulator 2k17 but I have a new one.....Never Ending Chase Simulator 2k17.You get to be a killer but you do not really kill anyone you put them on hooks and the other players just take them right back off......just an annoying experience of exploits. Since I purchased it on a 50% off sale I got a few fun matches but once all the new players left I soon found out why the wait times are ridiculous.....bc no one wants to be a killer so you have huge quenes of survivors and no killers. To make things worse the only way to be effective in killing anyone you have to tightly patrol the hooks you put people on which they have to stay on for a certain amount of time to die........which will get you hazed in the after game chat. Other than the visuals and a few good matches the only thing this experience was good for was seeing what other games people recommend instead of this heaping pile of elephant dung. Which is terrible since they would most likely sell a lot of DLC if it didn't suck. All in all meh spent $12 got $5 worth of game so I can feel good knowing I only lost $7.oh forgot the non esistant Match Maker so you will get paired against people who have hundreds of hours of gameplay and unlocks which I can't fathom why they hate themselves enough for that level of self punishment. Honestly the game would be 1000% better with an offline mode or PVE mode with bots that don't cheat. I mean it will have to be a PVE at some point bc no one wants to be a killer and for good reason.

I recommed getting it if you are a fan of asymmetrical survival games. Get it now or the best option would be to wait until its on sale.Edit One last thing I have against the game is that it is using peer to peer connection. Its the 21st century... there is no reason not to get dedicated servers. These constant lag switches and laggy lobbies (I check my ping every lobby doesnt mean the killer cant start a download mid game to increase the ping) are the major cause why I keep losing interest in this game.,Dead by Daylight

2017-02-17,0,0,1112,False,Recommended,Review updated to match with 1.9.1Some aspects of this game are still flawed amount and stun range of pallets ranking systems priorities for certain interactions (f.i. self healing instead of unhooking after being hit) hitboxes of a variety of objects and bugs.The rank reset (on every 13th of month) puts high ranked Killers into matches with possibly prior low ranked survivors which also makes for a very easy killing spree.As of 1.5 it is no longer possible to view/look up the Killer's Steam profile which is also an issue as this does not allow a survivor to make sure he isn't being put in a match with Killer they had blocked earlier be it either for a style of gameplay they do not enjoy to play against hackers and so one.I am aware that there are some survivors who will block and report for absoletly ridiculous reasons. On the other hand some Killers will dodge the lobby for ridiculous reasons like having more than 100 playtime hours or private profiles.Also all it takes for the Killer is to click on the Survivor's username in the lobby to see their profile and check their information (unless private). Very biased in my opinion...However although often frustrating this game is a lot of fun even without friends.The variety of Killers with different abilities makes for more alternation in gameplay which also requires a certain amount of skill to be obtained.There is still a lot to be changed about the mechanics of this game but the developers are very active and keep their community up to date all the time.Though in my opinion survivors should get points for the Surviving category based on how long they've been stealthy/in a match and instead escaping should only give off 3000 points instead of 5000. This would also make for a higher change of not losing a pip when being camped/mori'd after only a few minutes in or at least getting boldness points when the killer just stays all around you the whole time.I've had many matches in which being stealthy saved my life but eventually a gen will explode in my face when I want to let go of it (bc they hate me) leading to my death because the Killer is just close enough for me to not find a good hiding spot in time and then there's the frustration of depipping even though I had evaded the killer many times throughout the game.Another big wish I'd have is for (repeated) exploiters and hackers to just be permanently banned from the game since it seems that they are just let off way too softly many times.,Dead by Daylight

Frequent rubberbanding dropping of players etc. Very low skill floor for killers very high for survivors (ie not balanced) Game mechanics encourage the killer to camp once you're 'hooked' (ie countdown to bleedout) Chase mechanic centers around survivors avoiding the faster killers by using obstacles. But using these too much is an 'exploit' and so a bannable offense. Corrupts save files because apparently this is fine even a year+ after release. Use a friend's save because you don't want to start again from nothing? BANNED!Could have been an excellent game in better hands even with all its faults it's kind of addictive but... just stay away.

You'll be powerless to do anything about it because the devs keep nerfing killers to hell and back to the point that you don't play to enjoy yourself but to entertain survivors. That's right you're seen as their play thing to toy around with. They will tea bag insta blind body block pallet loop and insult you in the end match chat. Not the survivors nor the developers have any respect for the killer playerbase.If you like to have an incredibly frustrating stressful experience and play only to make it so that survies keep playing for our developer overlords you'll love By Daylight.Don't buy this turd.

They have made this game literally so killer oriented that is now impossible to juke a killer that is not blind and if you get hit once you will probably be instantly downed because their ""super rare perk"" that they added with the DLC is owned by every killer that has played more than 4 hours of the game. Their also used to be a free cam for survivors while they were running. GUESS WHAT?! It's gone. You can no longer predict a killer or learn to because you can't see him while running boards no longer stun for a proper duration and some killers can jump over them just as fast as you. Please do not give these people anymore money. They have ruined this game with update after update to favor the already favored killers.

2016-07-31,0,0,9,False,Not Recommended,"This *could* be a really good game unfortunately technical issues and questionable design decisions kill the fun.1) NetworkingThe biggest issue is the lack of dedicated servers. The ""killer"" hosts the game. Listen servers only work well if latency is good. But this game doesn't care about regions. Your killer could be on an island in the middle of nowhere or with a crappy ISP. Or the host plays on a crapp rig. The result is lag.Even worse you do not know until your game has started.Besides being the host gives you a huge advantage as the game is running smoothly for you.2) No real party systemYou want to play with a friend? Tough luck because you cannot! Well since the last patch (July 2016) you technically can but it is incredibly difficult to find a game with two (or three) free slots. I guess the systems works if you are a party of 5...3) MatchmakingNon existant. It's normal to play against higher ranked players with more experience than you (and better perks). Perks are not everything but seriously it's 2016!4) Key BindingsYep you cannot change the default bindings on a PC. Welcome to the stone age of gaming! Truth is there are not many keys to bind in the first place. But I am NOT a WASD player. It's sort of OK if I play as the Killer but it's nearly unplayable as a survivour (sprint and crouch).The game feels extremely unfinished. I would expect a more polished game from a seasoned developer studio.In its current state I cannot recommend this game.

2018-07-29,1,3,227,False,Not Recommended,"""Let's make an anti fun game.""Seems like the game design goal they got to achieve.DBD is a festival of unbalanced game mechanics focusing on making an easy life for the killer.Using only windows and pallets a survivor has little to no chances to evade the teleporting / invisible / sneaky and faster killer.Luckily enough for the killer s/he can easily break these pallets and do so faster if s/he decides to use a specific perk (in game ""skill"") Every single survivor's mechanic is easily countered by the killer's perks or basic abilities.A survivor can heal himself? It will show the killer where s/he is thanks to one perk.A survivor is far from a hooked mate? Her/his position will be known by the killer.If you decide to run as a survivor which you most of the time can't avoid to do jokes on you the killer can follow you without having you in sight.If the killer gets you s/he can easily reach one of the multiple hooks available all around the map making it impossible for the survivor to use the spam ""A D"" dodge mechanic.Good to know as well most of the time if you get hooked by a killer be prepared to get face camped until you die. It's not a problem for her/him since at the end of the game s/he will get more bloodpoints (in game currency) than the ""best"" survivor even killing just 1 out of 4. So why even try?Every update is a killer buff never adding new game mechanics for the survivor but implementing new ways for the killers to improve the ""anti fun"" policy.As a final point take into consideration before buying the game that most of the time at least one of the players rages quit may it be the killer or survivor.",Dead by Daylight

2016-11-09,0,0,408,False,Recommended,DBD is a fun game but does have quite a lot of bugs. Matchmaking is terrible right now (Veteran rank 1s will get matched with new Rank 20s) which can be quite troubling. Sometimes I also encounter glitchy rocks which makes it hard for me as a survivor to walk/crouch. The peer to peer system is also something I and other dislike. Because of it you'll sometimes get laggy matches (due to Killer hosting it) which can really make it unfun.That aside you can spend quite some time just screwing around with this game. Seeing great teamplay by your teammates is really refreshing too (bodyblock killers distraction etc..) or when the killer decides to be merciful to you. However most people probably won't reach this point. After all this game has a quite steep learning curve. New players won't immediately become good. It takes time and experience on dealing with the killer to learn how to play well and efficient against them. Learn to be unpredictable in what you do don't ever run in a straight line. Watching videos/streamers play DBD will also greatly help you improve as both a Killer or Survivor (I highly recommend this!). So basically don't feel bad when you keep dying as a new survivor or lose against good survivors as a new Killer. The Experiences you go through (which includes learning from your losses) is the key to becoming a better player.,Dead by Daylight

2016-06-20,0,0,433,False,Not Recommended,Dead by Daylight was a great idea ruined by incompetent developers. The game was fun at launch but has only gotten worse as the developers insist on balancing the game based on faulty statistics and the complaints of only one side of the community.The game is still asymmetrical but instead of it being a horror game where the survivors hide and sneak around a nigh unstoppable killer it's little more than a bullying simulator where the survivors taunt troll and harass a wounded declawed puppy. Imagine in the Friday the 13th movies instead of the victims running in fear of Jason they take away his machete kick him to the ground and shove his face in the mud. That's essentially the Dead by Daylight experience nowadays. Longstanding balance issues making the killers a chore to play have remained in the game for nearly a year while new killers or mechanics that survivors don't like are nerfed into the ground within a week or two. This is especially true with the A Nightmare on Elm Street DLC where the developers announced their intentions to nerf Freddy into the ground because low rank survivors were having a difficult time against him. Despite the fact that he was already considered laughably weak in high ranks.Does this logic make sense to anyone?Releast a new killer intended to shake up gameplay put game on sale to attract more new players Rebalance new killer based on complaints of these new players. I'm starting to wonder if this is some kinda social experiment to see just how much abuse one side of a community is willing to take before abandoning ship. Bottom line stay far far away from this game if you have any interest of playing killer. It's going the way of Evolve.,Dead by Daylight

2015-08-15,0,0,89,False,Recommended,I know I've only had this game less than 24 hours after purchasing it however I tuthfuly feel it's such an awesome game! I also love the idea that it has deidcated server support as well which is a bonus in my eyes especially when I go to LAN's a fair bit. Game graphics I give a high score mechanics are rather snazzy and definitely an enjoyable game all round. Now only thing that I must say that is a little bit on the down side is I did have a tiny bit of lag even choosing Oceanic server's however I was having net troubles I thing during such time so I'm not sure if it's just my internet connection that caused a tiny bit of lag during the 3rd match (3rd match only during near the end) or if it was just the host/whom or whatever that caused it. Anyway leaving on an overall definitely worth the $20 for the game normally now for me I bought the extra aka the sound track and first DLC and even then I'd say it was worth it. So game on dudes and dudettes!,Rocket League®

2015-08-08,0,0,14,False,Recommended,TO ALL NVIDIA LAPTOP USERS For some reason this game is poorly optmized for laptops with nvdia video cards. I could not get the game to run for over 10 seconds without crashing. Therefore I do not recommend this game if you have a laptop with an nvidia graphics card. However if you really want to play the game and you are willing to sacrifice some gameplay quality I have found a way to run the game on a stable 25 45 fps by tweaking some settings. I am currently plaing on an i7 at 2.00 GHz with a geforce 820m w/ 2 GB and 8 GB of ram. Here is what I did 1. In the 3d graphics settings on the nvidia control pannel I selected Rocket League and chose the nvidia processor (rather than the global configuration) in the graphics processor option.2. Reduced game resolution to be smaller than my screen and changed to borderless rather than full screen.3. Set all in game options to quality rather than high quality*optional I overclocked my cpu with msi afterburner and run razer cortex when playing (might help)Hope this helps.Sorry if there is not an in depth review I just wanted to see if I could help anyone who has trouble running this on a laptop. Still recommend the game though.,Rocket League®

The high speeds crazy goals and the rush of adrenaline as you rush to your own side of the pitch trying to defend your goal is really fun. The splitscreen mode and the option to go online with a buddy in splitscreen doubles the fun in my opinion. This game is definately 20 worth!,Rocket League®
2015-08-08,0,0,77,False,Recommended,I'm not a particularly big fan of football hell i'd rather do anything than watch it on TV so when this game came out I had no intention of buying it. It then started appearing on several of the youtube channels I follow *cough* Markiplier *cough* BYZE *cough cough* and yeah it looked like a lot of fun. Ended up buying it and now i'm bloody hooked! Seriously good fun easy to get into takes a little longer to master the controls though. It plays really well the connection can be pretty sketchy (lag terribly) at the start of some matches but for the majority of the time it runs really well.Definitely worth the money football fan or not you should get this game you wont regret it!,Rocket League®

Jeg likte veldig godt det var så billig til å være helt nytt vanligvis er de nye spillene ganske dyre. Du kan customize din egen bil velge blant visse farger og hatter. Du har forskellige modes du kan spille som f.eks. 1v1 2v2 3v3 4v4 SOLO 1v1 SOLO 2v2 SOLO 3v3 og SOLO 4v4. Det vil komme mange DLCer etterhvert og mange nye biler og baner.

2016-09-27,0,0,27,False,Recommended,"Rocket League is what some would describe it to be a ""soccar"" game that has you commandeering a vehicle and using it to get a ball into the opponent's goal. It's basically ""Crash Course Football"" in a dystopian setting involving nitrous oxide and rocket jumping.The abilties applied are equivalent to that of an acutal footballer/soccer player such as ""Bicycle Hit"". It's more simplified from the typical soccer simulators to perform these abilites since you're driving a ball into your oppenent's goal with your car. Because of these simplified mechanics it allows you to construct even the most spontaneous techniques making for an intense set of games. But the game is difficult to get used to due to its implementation of physics.The customization options are quite accessorizing. You can select from various different cars including the DeLorean and Batmobile if you have the DLC You can alter the colors for the specific teams and you can also select the fuel trail wheels roof accessory and antenna for the car.One of the two special game modes is Hoopz a basketball version of the game that makes it more challenging and skill based for the players. This mode pushes you to utilize advanced ablilties in order to put the ball into the hoop. The other mode is Rumble which involves randomly generated powerups that give you a better advantage of scoring a goal. These powerups include a harpoon freezing the ball and switching places with your oppenent.In conclusion this is most definitive form of soccar to play. This game was build from the very concept of soccar and fully executed into a broader experience giving you addtional ways to play. Despite struggling with it at fiirst this game will be the most fun you'll ever have with friends.",Rocket League®

Haven't used all the cars in the game but most of the ones I've tried have great control. What's tough is trying to time a hit when the ball is in the air I'm always over shooting. Match making is faily quick with most games connecting in less than 30 seconds. It's waiting for others that take a long time when you're just sitting there idling in front of the goal.Overall it's a game I highly recommend. Having a controller is a must.,Rocket League®
2016-12-27,0,0,198,False,Recommended,The best if not only Carball simulator. Pros Hundreds of hours of gameplay and lots of modes to play.

Huge player base and cross network play with PS4 players. Great controller support Split screenCons Crates are now pay to open. Servers can sometime be overloaded and cause lag.Rocket League is one of those staple games that anyone with a PC or Console should own. Matches are only 5 minutes and yet they are so much fun.

2016-03-07,0,0,524,False,Recommended,"More than likely you've heard at least something about this game by now but if you don't know what this game is already Rocket League is a multiplayer competitive sports game(well sortof) in which rocket powered cars are controlled by individual players that go head to head in a soccer(or football if you live outside the US) like match. It doesn't offer a ton of content(though patches over the past several months have added things like mutators hockey mode and more recently crazier map designs with rocket labs) but what it does it does very well. Its simple on the surface thanks to straightforward controls and its similarity to real life sports but its very hard to master. This is due to the dynamic nature of the game the near limitless things you can do with your car as well as things like teamplay tactics and general strategy/positioning. This game gives you complete control over what you do with your car and how you hit the ball so making big stops crucial steals and insane goals all feel very satisfying. I personally ended up putting somewhere around 250+ hours across both the PS4 and PC versions of the game over the course of the 8 months or so its been released at the time of this review so I'd say its well worth the price of admission. The servers could be a little better but overall if you've ever seen gameplay of this game and thought ""hey this looks like fun"" I highly recommend checking this game out.",Rocket League®

2016-06-05,0,0,47,False,Recommended,I like this game. It is hard but that makes it so much fun. Some game are too easy to apeal to more people but i think a hard is really rewarding. The cross plaform is a feature that I like. It is kind of a bummer that you can not chat to ps4 user and you can only use quick chat but sony made sure this happened. I can not wait for this game to come to linux so i can play it without using window. This game has competence autonomy and relatedness. Compentence as you are always making progress and when you score or master something it make full of joy. Autonomy is when you have complete control of your choise and the game. You can customize your car choise game modes like hockey and you have control over the ball in free play. Relatedness is when you feel that you matter and you are making a contribution to the game. You feel you matter when you clear the ball save the ball from going in and when you score. when you play multiplayer you feel that you are need and you helped your team win. This game covers the 3 thing to a good game and that makes it apeal to alot of gamers. Alot of people are playing this game and you can play with any platform(pc ps4 and xbox one). This game is fun to play with friend or anyone.,Rocket League®

2016-06-29,0,0,35,False,Recommended,Great Game! Fix your ing ranking system and que system had the game for about an hour and was put against VETERANs and MASTERs. The game itself is amazing however it sucks donky when you get put up against someone who has played since the games release and u have had it for around an hour. i dont give two if there is a season that just ended it make no ing sense. Also it took me about 6 wins to rank up once then i lost one game and div down. The div down would have made sense if i had lost by a lot but im semi pro and was against an EXPERT and lost by 1 goal. Then the following game I div down when i lost in ing OVERTIME against a VETERAN. Honestly its stupid as if i had lost by 3 or even 2 then maybe i would understand but one ing point loss to a player with over 400x my play time (LITERALY) come on wtf. Once again the game itself is great but if you dont like to play against people who have no life when you are brand new to the game then i guess you have to lookup when the ing season didnt just end and play then.,Rocket League®

The only person that can increase your capability...is you getting better at the game.Thankfully this process in and of itself is extremely fun. You will cackle madly at how bad you are when you first start this game. The flipping the demolitions the ball bouncing everywhere...it's an absolute blast!

2017-07-15,0,0,17,False,Not Recommended,The worst game I've ever played. After playing 17 hours you think more or less learned to play and now it's time matchmaking. The game doesn't think so. After you start matchmaking you know what to do there's nothing for you until you have earned 1 000 hours and then you learn all the replays of professionals. EACH player on EACH rank will pull you in on their little The matchmaking system is at negative level the worst game I have ever seen. I ve calibrating in the Silver 2 Division 3 along with my friend but literally the day I became Bronze 1 Division 1 thanks to the developers for a good selection of opponents.

2016-01-21,0,0,613,False,Recommended,Overall a great game if I were to sum it up I would say it is easy to play but hard to master. There is a certain depth to the game that makes it interesting and fun at teh same time. With this being said the skill cap is very high and I have found that after about 20 hours you can see a marked improvement in your play. If you say this game is bad because you lose all the time please shut up because it is just a game and if you are losing pick up your game. If you lose say gg and do better next time. That is the nature of this game. Some nit picky things that will help in large ways actually hitting the ball often times players go for the ball and swerve left or right too early but with practice this game be avoided the majority of the time knowing when to hit the ball when close to either goal if you are near the enemies goal try to center it for a teamate and if enemies are near your base use common sense centering it isnt always the best idea lastly use your quick chat it will allow for better communication as a team and overall better teamwork. If you don't play this game I recommend it and hope I see you in game!,Rocket League®

The cars are great and the extras and customizations are neat. The game seems stabile and not overdone although some fields (maps) seem to lag a bit more than others.

2016-02-12,0,0,176,False,Recommended,This game has some of the most wonderful gameplay i have ever enjoyed. Scoring gives so much satisfaction! In my opinion everything in this game has been done right. The graphics are just right for this type of game not ugly and not too rich or distracting personally i think the game looks awesome. The customization is also a big bonus you can make so many different variations of cars. You never come across with someone looking like you. When you start playing you might find the mechanics difficult as you keep on playing you see however that the learning curve is terrific you can pick up certain moves easily and practicing them quickly helps you get better. What i like the most about this game is that even though it's pvp you don't ever feel any pressure it's a fun casual game even when you are skyping with friends and tryharding to win. Rocket League is also a game that's right for any type of gamer. It doesn't matter if you prefer MOBAs FPS RPG MMO or anything else this game will in every case be a great go to when wanting to play something relaxing and enjoyable. It's the game i have the most fun in when playing and it probably will be for a long time. Honestly everyone should have this game and play from time to time i don't know what other game i would recommend to everyone not even taking in account their tastes.,Rocket League®

2017-09-16,0,0,882,False,Recommended,I was both into and not into Rocket League from the start. Let me explain. I played it for about 10 hours in several couch 2v2 multiplayer split screen sessions and it was instant fun. Total party hit even though none of us were any good at it.But for some odd reason the competitive online play was just something I never considered doing since I figured it would be unpleasant at my ultra low n00b skill level. So I never played online.Until I did and it was fun. And I kept playing. And I keep getting better. The online ranking keeps you playing with and against players in your skill level and this is the thing with a really good esport game like Rocket League the learning curve is really long but not steep. It's instant fun but will take many hundreds of hours (if not thousands) to reach some level of mastery.Be warned you will occasionally bump into toxic chat online but you can disable it or learn to ignore because there are plenty of nice people too. Also if you have kids chances are they will absolutely love playing rocket league too. My 2 sons play this on tv with steamcontrollers on a homebrew steam machine with/against bots (offline local mutliplayer).My only gripe with the game would be that as you get better you'll soon discover you need to start changing your controller layout. They should've fixed that from the start. So I advise you to change the button mapping when playing for the first time. (at least remap powerslide/air roll. google it.)End Verdict highly recommended,Rocket League®

2015-08-13,0,0,25,False,Recommended,I really enjoy this game it has an old skool simplicity about it.Object is simple you just have to get the big ball in the back of the other teams goal using a vehicle and that vehicle can wear a hat. You can jump dash by flipping about and boost using a limited suppy of replenishable boosty nitro type stuff. The graphics are pretty and controls are nice and tight.Sure I'd like to see some options to tweak weight and gravity (ball and cars) here and there to maybe fine tune things to my liking. And I'd like a bit more custommization of AI behaviour and car stats in general to give them some individuality but that's just me. It's a tough one you don't want to unbalance the game by having some vehicles having an advantage over others. But having some with more speed over strength seems like a good way to seperate them cos' as it stands they all seem the same performance wise except that some are physically bigger and therefore that may already give them an advantge over the smaller ones all other things being equal.Anywho this game is fun fluid entertainment easy to pick up hard to master and gets people around the screen in the way games used to years ago... surely a good thing. Maybe you will get a bit tired as there is a lack of different game types/variations. Still it's worth a look.Update This game has had a lot of developer support since my initial rambling. Some of the in game options I had wanted to see are now available. It has new maps and tweaks and just keeps on getting better.,Rocket League®

2016-11-15,1,1,82,False,Recommended,There are two games that I consider to be my favorite games of all time Super Mario World the SNES classic with a heart of gold and gameplay which I still can't quite find anywhere else and Rocket League which fits that exact same build. I have a penchant for games wherein I can jump. SMW's got that obviously 'cause Mario games are about jumping. Rocket League a game about RC cars playing soccer for what I assume are stadiums filled with balloons also has jumping. And aerials. And sick sick stunts. This game looks great feels great and is loads of fun.I originally purchased Rocket League for my PS4 but I sold that so I can get a sick gaming rig and the main reason I considered the switch to be a valid one was because my beloved was still available on the new ship I was choosing to jump to. I still use my PS4 controller which works perfectly with InputMapper so it's like I never left. I do choose to use custom controls as I feel like the standard controls are a bit clunky for aerial play but hey thankfully there's custom controls. It's really a minor complaint.DLC is plentiful and cheap and I never regret making a purchase on something even if I rarely use or equip it simply because Psyonix is constantly pumping out new game modes and arenas as well as providing great support to their users and community on their Rocket League subreddit.,Rocket League®

2016-08-03,1,1,970,False,Recommended,So far as game play is concerned everything is pitch perfect. Where other games rely on an arbitrary skill ceiling to maintain challenges Rocket League's skill ceiling is a variety of creativity reaction time tenacity deceit acrobatics and more. There is truly depth to Rocket League and I can't say that about 80% of the games available today. The purely aesthetic loot system is wonderful. It made taking the game too seriously difficult and subsequently the edgy bad manners players are less prevalent. Though now the loot system is starting too look all too familiar. Introducing a grinding component to acquiring loot as opposed to more liberally distributing loot. I suppose the hat on my car doesn't actually matter and they haven't touched the core game play but the intention behind implementing a more grind like loot system is step one in creating a market that threatens to consume the rest of the game. The moment options are taken away to stimulate more loot value that thumbs up is turning into a thumbs down and I'll write a new review from my adobe yurt in the Himalayas as the last thing I ever loved was gobbled up by laissez faire capitalism.,Rocket League®

2015-09-18,0,0,20,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a great game with three modes. In Player vs AI mode you compete against up to seven opponents to try to stop your computer controlled teammates from driving the ball all the way from the enemy goal line straight into your own goal. In Player vs Player mode helpful mentors within the community will recommend you not play the game at all because Rocket League like fencing and squash is a game of elites and a sport of which the underclasses are unworthy. The last game mode is my favorite in which you peacefully drive around a field alone with the ball for a few minutes while waiting for your audience with the Bronze Ranked Queue House of Lords.10/10 would drive around an empty field alone again,Rocket League®

2017-07-05,0,0,183,False,Recommended,Awesome fun 5 minutes at a time. Easy learning curve so it's very easy to get started. Devilishly difficult to master with an enormous number of tricks and abilities to learn. The multi player has a few glitches here and there (most annoyingly you usually will keep playing the same people over and over unless you drop out and rejoin the queue). The multi player is otherwise great with the typically poisonous atmosphere of other games not being a big deal because the games only last 5 minutes and you can quit at any time.,Rocket League®

2016-01-16,0,0,73,False,Recommended,Amazing game way more fun than I expected. DLC is done right i.e. all items are cosmetic there's no pay to win model. All cars have equal sized hitboxes and equal sized boost capacity. One of the few games where the only difference between winning and losing is skill. There's no theorycrafting no spreadsheets no lame stats etc. Just plain fun.The only letdown is that it's a bit of a wild west as far as cheating is concerned. One of the problems I've particularly encountered is what I can best describe as 'multiboxing' as in World of Warcraft where one player controls more than one character simultaneously. Often leads to a very unfair advantage. Also it would be great if there were a feature to report AFK players and offensive player nicks.,Rocket League®

Slightly mild learning curve at first but once u get the physics and the vehicles controls down the rest just comes naturally.One thing I would recommend for me using a console controller just felt a lot easier for controlling thr vehicles compared to a mouse &amp keyboard combo.

The graphics are up to par as well as the actual gameplay itsself. The game great because of its versatile range of gameplay and the small amount of trolls I personally have encountered in the community. The game includes many different gamemodes such as hockey basketball etc. It also allows you to change the settings(i.e. speed of your car size of the ball and level of gravity) in multiplayer mode with friends and the ranking system is decently accurate. All in all the game is fantastic the next big thing.,Rocket League®

2016-10-29,0,0,389,False,Recommended,If you ever thought that cars and soccer wouldn't mix you are a retard. It is like two people were asked to say the first thing that came to their mind and this was the end result. If you like high flying high speed stunt action with a soccer ball then this is it. The game is as serious as you want it to be and equally as comical as you can imagine cars and soccer to be. Even before the rumble addition had been added this game was addicting. Rumble only served to make the gameplay that much more comical and addicting at the same time.,Rocket League®

2015-11-24,0,0,2136,False,Recommended,Been playing this game a while if fun frustrating and heart pounding. Learning to fly is the best part and will give you the advantage over the ball every time. The collection of parts is addictive with customisation being fun each DLC adds enough parts to change how you can look in a variety of ways.Team colours are are reduced for pratical sake but secondary paint colours are enough to fill any belly. Yes yes Black aswel. After playing this long enough black wont be enough.Most DLC has extra cars with them these cars usually have new paint jobs for just them. So dont expect Flames to be for every car.Parts Car Paint colours Hats radio Antenna ends Wheels Rocket Stream.Each part is unlocked as you play usually one per match. sometimes there'll be even only items for example Halloween had some bits you will only see from players who played at that time.Just think Nitro on an RC car.,Rocket League®

2017-07-24,0,0,661,False,Recommended,Addictive game. Great gameplay servers are typically good the business model has gotten worse with time.

2017-06-19,1,1,912,False,Recommended,I've heard greatness of this game and so I decided to try it. I myself usually play MMO's or FPS' but I had to give this a shot. Little did I know that I was getting myself into a new addiction.The games are usually very short but very face paced so you can play multiple games within an hour easily. The gameplay itself is very unique and smooth kind of like Hot Wheels or Twisted Metal (without the weapons) meets soccer/football. It's very tricky to get used to at first but once you do you'll want to better yourself and play more and more.There is a TON of car customization and loads of different cars to choose from in this great game. From cute little puppies on your roof to snake eyes on your rims! Most items are earned through random drops rewarded to those that complete their games. There are however crates for those that want to spend a few bucks and maybe get something more but again you can get most things in game via end game rewards. The only gripe that I have is that the servers sometimes don't put you into a match this isn't around your rank. You can be Pro/Expert and play with Rookies or vise versa. Other than that this game is absolutely great unique fun and I highly recommend it to anyone out there!...........................................................................................................TL DRPros+ Emmersive gameplay+ Casual &amp Competitive gamemodes+ Friendly community+ Lots of car customization+ Great soundtracks+ Amazing car handling and air mechanics+ Holiday/E sports events+ Developers really listen to the communityCons Servers are sometimes slow to respond and give poor performance (EU) Can be placed in a game with much higher ranks as a noobRating 4.5 / 5,Rocket League®

No my friend. This is not just any tea. This is a bottomless pit of chai picked from bright tropical rainbow fields. The steering is exquisite imagine delicately picking tea leaves with a humvee's grill with your tire treads spawning a billion new seedlings yet crushing none. Imagine the humvee runs on raw spices its smoke an aromatic blend of cinammon cardamon nutmeg and cloves. Imagine the humvee is filled with an oxygenated mass of ginger and lemon that you can float and breathe in and now you are flipping the tea leaves by flipping your fat humvee 720 degrees you are weightless and not remotely ill. Now you hop you leap and you are flying through the air. You're in a rocketship humvee and you're not as free as a bird but those tea leaves they are yours. And sometimes not there are others floating about making tea and sometimes they steal a sip of yours and vice versa but you don't mind at all in no small part because none of you are remotely milk intolerant and the clouds are branded A2 proteins. The heavens are raining warm honey milk down upon you your humvee is burping steam through the leaves and you are on a planet of foaming chai latte.That is Rocket League.,Rocket League®

2016-11-27,0,0,156,False,Recommended,It's 3v3 soccer (futsal?) with rocket cars a match made in heaven. Success depends on a mix of technical skill reading the opponents and common sense strategy. At the same time there's plenty of chaos nobody can control the ball forever anyone can put the ball in the goal and an amazing play can happen at any time. The controls feel great and offer a wide range of motion riding up walls high speeds and even flight...after some practice. Player eliminations (executed by hitting an opponent at full speed) aren't rewarded or condoned in any way by themselves but sometimes they're exactly what you need to win.Rocket League was my favorite game the month it launched and it's still getting better every month. It's great alone online and even in local multiplayer. Essential Steam.,Rocket League®

2015-10-27,0,0,90,False,Recommended,A very simple game with a very simple concept something that most modern day multiplayer games lack but Rocket League excels at. As a football (soccer) fan this game does incredibly well to capture the drama and emotion of the beautiful game. I've had games where my team was 4 0 down with 2 minutes left only to turn it around and win 5 4 with the last shot going in at the 05 mark. On the flip side we've conceded last second goals in ranked that left everyone questioning their existence. On top of this the developers have not dissapointed with the super cheap DLC! Which is of course optional and does not have any impact on gameplay if you choose not to purchase. The first flawless cross platform matchmaking I've seen. Take note EA some developers do care. This game brings about the same feelings I had for Super Mario Strikers back in the day. Just about as good as a simple multiplayer game can get. Play it with your friends and you're bound to have some laughs talk some trash and score some amazing goals.,Rocket League®

2016-01-01,0,0,3,False,Recommended,Rocket League is the third installment in Nickelodeon's hit series Rocket Power. The kids having been in a fatal accident and being amputees they pursue the only reasonably radical sport they can soccer with cars. The players are divided into two teams bodacious blue and osogood orange and together players fight over big balls. The game is quite good but however sometimes it becomes a bit frustrating when you don't get the gnarly score you thought you'd get because of some whack attack physics. If you're like me and you don't wanna fool cuz you're cool I'd reccomend that you shred on this game with a homie g. This game is meant to be enjoyed with a ploy for friends to the end ya dig.

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9 inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10 inch circle. Cut into 8 (1 inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips one at a time into a lattice pattern.

2015-07-24,1,1,746,False,Recommended,This game is FANTASTIC! Other game devs take notes on how smoothly this game plays and runs 1 WEEK AFTER LAUNCH! This game is so near perfect that it is crazy. Most games that have been out for many years are more buggy then this game that was released a mere week ago. As somebody who is not really into soccer this game pulls you in and makes you play for hours at a time. The game looked boring at first but when I began to play it I threw that idea away instantly. Pros + Some of the best co op play ever.+ Amazingly competitive gameplay.+ Some of the fastest matchmaking I have ever witnessed.+ Great servers.+ Awesome customization of your car.+ Cross compatibility with the Ps4.+ Great controller support.+ Very clean game no crashes or bugs ever witnessed.+ Sweet graphics. Cons That annoying vuvuzela sound at the beginning of games. Once you unlock all items for the cars game becomes a tad bit stale. Please for the love of all that is holy buy this game.

2016-03-19,0,0,453,False,Recommended,Now that i have finally reached 100 hours in this game i feel i can finally give a good review of it. Rocket League is a game that has the old school gaming feel where you can just start the game and within seconds be connected to a game really good for the pick up and play if you dont have much time. Playing by yourself can be dull at time given that you sometimes may be paired up with people that are too good or people that like goofing around which can cause the game to be stressful. When you play competitive this gives you a whole new reason to not fool around and play serious because the matches and points matter that is what i mostly play on. Playing with people from your friends list can add a huge amount of fun to the game because you are playing with them more and more over time and then you start to build that team chemistry and then the real fun begins. All in all this game is good when you are pressed for time but this game can also cut into your other games because this game can be so fun and you constantly will lose track of time. Overall this game is a solid 9/10 for the price point and the hours you can play it is a massive positive and well worth the money. Get it and go out and get your boost on.,Rocket League®

Now on to the game play the game is simple your a car and you must play a very weird version of soccar. when driving around destroying other cars hitting the ball around or making goals you will a get a huge sense of hype and excitment. you will find your self boosting yourself up and down the arenas causing massive chaos just to get a big ball full of gas in a goal. the hectic nature of the game takes several notes from actual sports like soccar and hockey and transforms it into a crazy arcade like sci fi sport i would expect to only see in a 90's action movie.

I have never played a game more defined by ""easy to learn hard to master"" than this because after almost 300 hours I've still barely scratched the surface of what techniques can be used to win.

2015-09-26,0,0,1790,False,Recommended,"Over 1000 hours invested now... and Rocket League has fallen into the trap that most games of this era seem to have fallen into. They are growing too fast for their own skin and are trying to juggle too many things at once.When it was launched Rocket League was an extremely solid game that had little to no bugs or glitches or connection problems. It was just a reliable and fun game that I could count on. Now that it has blown up in popularity and has become an offical ""E Sport"" I feel the developer Psyonix has lost sight of its roots. Like every single solitary game that's available today Rocket League decided that microtransactions in the form of randomly obtainable crates that require keys to open for $1 each was the way it was going to make it's income. This is a good business model with the exception that they don't seem to be focusing on the core aspects of the game anymore namely the rock solid continuity that used to exist in the game before it's extreme popularity. More and more I find myself going for a shot and the ball travels right through my car like it was never there. This is even backed up by the in game replay of goals showing the trail that's left behind the ball after a player makes contact being skewed showing that something happened at that point but was ultimately ignored. The most recent Championship Series had a $250 000USD prize pool which leaves me wondering why they don't spend that money on keeping their servers maintained and in perfect working order. I really do love this game more than any game I've loved in the past and I want to see it continue to grow but I fear Psyonix is on the wrong path currently. They seem to be trying to emulate Counter Strike Global Offensive with the way they are doing things now. Focused more on creating more avenues for microtransactions than actually ensuring their game is playable by the people who will keep coming back.All in all still a fantasic game and I will still try to keep a positive attitude towards the future of this game. I just hope they realize that theres more to it than microtransactions. 80hrs later and I finally write a review of this one. If you haven't played it yet then just do. It's such a fantasic game I can't even explain it in words. Sure I hear you ""It's soccer with cars"" and yeah you're right. BUT! It's soooo much more than just than. If you're either a soccer fan a car fan OR BOTH you'll know that neither is simple yet both are awesome in their own right! So imagine that both are super awesome and are colliding like 2 huge galaxies of epicness making a massive spectical of amazing..... that's Rocket League. Buy it. Play it. Love it.

Even though the levels are pretty much the same and the cars can only be upgraded on their cosmetics its the simplicity and depth that make this game shine. Matches of 5 minutes make the game very intense and scoring some skill goals or blocking some insane shots are satisfying. For me its worth the price.

2015-11-12,0,0,32,False,Recommended,Rocket League is a highly addictive game due to its mix of football and cars it isnt specific in its audience so anyone can enjoy it. Car customization is great allowing for a unique player look. It is quick to pick up and it takes time to build up the skill to be great at timing your shots and doing tricks etc. I would say that it is more of a game you would play for half an hour or so rather than long runs as it can get repetitive but it takes time for the novelty to wear off and it is something I seriously recommend playing for a laugh with friends.,Rocket League®

2016-01-16,0,0,61,False,Recommended,Rocket League is easily one of the best games of 2015. I've never had this much fun in a game in awhile. Rocket League brings something totally new to the table soccer with RC cars. Pure Genius.Rocket League is such a simple game to learn but such a hard game to master. There are tons of different moves you can learn how to do and master. It would seem by the idea of hitting a huge ball with an RC car that is all a bunch of randomness but there actually is a method to all this madness. Rocket League also does have a ranking system there are ranked games and un ranked games. You also have your own personal level that classifys you as either a Rookie Semi Pro Pro Veteran Expert Master Legend and finally the Rocketeer.Rocket League also offers tons of different visual upgrades for your cars thatr you can earn by completing games. There are many different types of bodies to choose from as well as different boost trails flags toppers different types of paints and decals.Rocket League offers so much content for such a low price and has many different DLC to get also which can improve your experience even more. Rocket definitely deserves a 10/10 and a recommended from me!,Rocket League®

2017-05-07,0,0,15,False,Recommended,Product received for free. Rocket League is an amazing game. You should totally buy it if you have the money. Even though I don't have it I will buy it if the price goes down. Otherwise 20$ is a little expensive for me but most people in this world are rich so they will probably buy it right away. Once you get good at the game it's totally fun but if you are new to this game and keeep on ball chasing then it may not be as fun. You need to be willing to put time into this game but if you can't put that much time into this game then don't buy it. I really reccomend a controller because it ehances your experience. Keyboard and mouse was very confusing controls but that's just me.,Rocket League®
2016-07-22,0,0,134,False,Recommended,Even if you don't care about sports or racing this game is so fast paced and zany that you can't help but want to play one more match. It can be difficult to pick up at first and I really do recommend you do the practice sessions first so you can acquaint yourself with how to move your vehicle around the best way. You'll probably fumble a lot trying to hit the ball at all let alone accurately. The great thing about this game though is that it's always fun even if you suck. Playing the game with friends is highly recommended too as it absolutely doubles the fun and I really like how matchmaking takes parties into account to assure you'll be on the same team as your friends in online play.The one thing that I'll complain about is that the AI can still do really dumb things even if you're playing at higher skill levels I have seen some bots just casually drive the ball into their own goal for no reason. It can be quite frustrating to play offline if you're essentially carrying your team.I should also mention that if you're ever starting to get bored of the standard arenas I highly recommend you try some of the rocket lab arenas to completely change things up. It seems right now that not many people play on them but I promise you they are worth it and demand a whole new strategy and style of play.,Rocket League®

Beginners will have fun but when you start pulling off crazy moves like rocket jumps and saves it gets pretty exciting. The game has tons of unlockables to keep you interested but honestly it's just extra because the gameplay is where this game really shines. It's fun to play alone but a blast to play with friends plus it has split screen co op if you have multiple controllers and while you can play with a mouse and keyboard i highly suggest using a controller.Graphically the game looks amazing sharp graphics and effects vibrant colors. Plus it is optimized really well i'm pretty sure you could run this game on a microwave.Don't think my 11 hours played mean anything i bought the game 2 weeks ago and i'm going to keep coming back to it for a long time.

2016-12-05,0,0,53,False,Recommended,Rocket League is possibly one of the best games I ever played on Steam! As I keep on returning to it as much As I can!It is a fast paced game were you play as a mini car and make attempts to score against the enemy team similar to real sports like soccer hockey and basketball! And this is coming from a guy who doesn't care much about sports! But the game is so engaging that I just can't help myself but to play! But on the other hand this game can be repetitive at times and can cause eye strain if you play for too long! The season mode also kind of stinks. But regardless of that this game is a BLAST and would reccommend it to anyone including those who aren't into sports very much!Final Score 8.5/10 Epic game!,Rocket League®
2017-02-01,1,1,1499,False,Recommended,This game has grown a lot from the bottom to the top. Its so addicting!! It needs a lot of practice tought.

And if you want to watch entertaining videos check our JHZER's youtube channel! He does some overpowered stuff. There are more things to do aswell! You can open crates and get stuff to costumize your car with. If you want to give your friend a useless item you can trade him the item. You can also buy dlc's that give new cars and costumasation. Buy the game. You will love it and you will meet new friends to play with!,Rocket League®
2016-04-03,1,1,639,False,Recommended,"Fair warning I was mostly just thinking out loud when I wrote this down .Seriously there's zero learning curve. (XBOX 360 controller) So to perform a proper kick flip in rocket league you hit A to jump angle yourself by pressing forwards or back on the joystick and hitting A again. For an air boost. if you're ever out of boost simply kick flipping repeatedly can get you going just as fast as full boost and in a shorter distance.I thought a kick flip was just a front flip until I experimented with it. Pvp is stupid easy if you kick flip all over the place. Someone added me to steam earlier cause ""you play like a lunatic"" Apparently it's not normal to see someone kick flipping for boost speeds and blocks or shots. I have yet to run into someone who uses their full boost at first ball and kick flip into it.10/10 so far able to get first touch by kick flipping out of boost. Sometimes I get solid goals out of first touch cause they don't expect that kind of power behind the ball. Kick flipping straight out of boost is so OP. You can basically travel with the ball and air whip it with x a second time to shoot it anywhere you want. People leave so quick when they see it. The rage is real.I thumbs up this game cause it's a lot of fun the challenge is decent the graphics are pretty and the gameplay is top notch. I will however voice that I wish there weren't so many people who shoot the ball into our own goal. I mean c'mon guys...",Rocket League®

Its competetive mode doesn't take nearly as much time as say CS GO or LoL and it's perfect for eSports. A player who has never played or heard of the game can easily watch and understand a tournament where very good players are competing.

I first took site of this game in september of 2015 when i saw it basically ""storm"" the youtube gaming page so i looked and saw it was only on Playstation/PC. I was distraught because I only had an xbox at the time. I wanted to see if there was a way to port it over but no dice. I eventually just decided to wait until I had enough money to buy a gaming pc so i did. D around january I had enough from christmas with the relatives and my savings to buy an Alienware and what was the first thing I did? Sent it back because it had a faulty server connector but what did I do when i got the second computer? I went onto steam and got Rocket league D I played it for I believe 10 hours before going to bed then playing it again the next morning. I played it for about a month when low and behold Rocket League comes out on Xbox which both made me mad and made me laugh. I had JUST got the game (for a month or so). I just laughed it off and played more and more. I got enough money to buy all the dlc (all except NBA flags which wasnt out at the time but who cares). The game has gotten better ever since with hoops Rocket Labs more cars more maps more awesomeness! This game gets an 11/10... ney a 6 stars out of 5... ney an ""I r8 9/8"" from a tumblr addict.... NEY it gets my gratitude and my respect (plus all the stuff i said and a thumbs up recommendation). This game has inspired me to make a trickshot vine (It's_MagicRL) to which im not very good but I'm at least trying and I have hit decent things. I love this game and I dont think I'll ever stop playing it. Cheers! D It's_Magic/MagicBraden1",Rocket League®

2017-07-04,0,0,336,False,Recommended,One of the best games I have ever played. The 5 minute game length makes it perfect for when you want to take a break inbetween working sessions. It's easy to play but hard to master which means it has a very high skill ceiling. You can play for hundreds of hours and still have a lot to improve. Remember to keep your camera locked to the ball and only switch when you are going to turn back and get the boosts!,Rocket League®
